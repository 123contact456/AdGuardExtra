# AdGuard Extra

AdGuard Extra is a userscript (or a browser extension) that is supposed to fight ad blocking circumvention attempts which become more and more and popular. Regular ad blocking rules do not allow us being as flexible as it's necessary, that's why AdGuard Extra was developed.

AdGuard Extra comes pre-installed with all premium AdGuard versions for if you use it, you don't need to do anything.
However, if you want to use it alongside AdGuard browser extension or any other ad blocker, you'll need to use an additional extension.
